An implementation of selected machine learning algorithms for basic natural language processing in golang.  The initial focus for this project is [Latent Semantic Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis) to allow retrieval/searching, clustering and classification of text documents based upon semantic content.

Built upon the [gonum/gonum matrix library](https://github.com/gonum/gonum) with some inspiration taken from Python's [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

Check out [the companion blog post](http://www.jamesbowman.me/post/semantic-analysis-of-webpages-with-machine-learning-in-go/) or [the go documentation page](https://godoc.org/github.com/james-bowman/nlp) for full usage and examples.

## Features

* [Sparse matrix](http://github.com/james-bowman/sparse) implementations for more effective memory usage
* Convert plain text strings into numerical feature vectors for analysis
* Stop word removal to remove frequently occuring English words e.g. "the", "and"
* Feature hashing implementation ('the hashing trick') (using [MurmurHash3](http://github.com/spaolacci/murmur3))for reduced memory requirements and reduced reliance on training data
* TF-IDF weighting to account for frequently occuring words
* LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis aka Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)) implementation using truncated SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) for dimensionality reduction.
* Cosine similarity implementation to calculate the similarity (measured in terms of difference in angles) between feature vectors.

## Planned

* Pipelining of transformations to simplify usage e.g. vectorisation -> tf-idf weighting -> truncated SVD
* Ability to persist trained models
* LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) implementation for topic extraction
* Stemming to treat words with common root as the same e.g. "go" and "going"
* Querying based on multiple query strings (using their centroid) rather than just a single query string.
* Support partitioning for the Latent Semantic Index (LSI)
* Clustering algorithms e.g. Heirachical, K-means, etc.
* Classification algorithms e.g. SVM, random forest, etc.
